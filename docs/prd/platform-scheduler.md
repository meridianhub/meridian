# Platform Scheduler PRD

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Platform Team
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11

## Executive Summary

Meridian has three independent cron scheduler implementations across payment-order
(BillingScheduler), reconciliation (SettlementScheduler), and forecasting
(CronScheduler). Each re-implements the same lifecycle machinery: cron engine
setup, graceful shutdown with in-flight work tracking, mutex-guarded state, and
Redis-based distributed locking. Only the reconciliation scheduler has
DB-backed execution tracking with missed-window catch-up - a capability that
every scheduled workload in a multi-tenant system requires.

This PRD defines a shared `platform/scheduler` package that extracts the
common patterns into a single, well-tested abstraction, and establishes
DB-backed execution awareness as the baseline for all scheduled work.

## BIAN Alignment

BIAN explicitly favours **distributed choreography over centralised
orchestration**. Each Service Domain manages its own scheduling as an
autonomous capability. Creating a central scheduling service that "wakes up"
other services would violate BIAN's principles of Service Domain encapsulation
and loose coupling.

This PRD follows BIAN's prescribed pattern: extract **shared scheduling
infrastructure** (a library) while preserving each Service Domain's autonomy
over its own scheduled work.

### BIAN Terminology Mapping

| Meridian Concept | BIAN Concept | Reference |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Shared scheduler library | Scheduling Infrastructure (reusable capability) | Service Domain autonomy principle |
| `ScheduleProvider` | PROCESS functional pattern (schedule loading) | Practitioner Guide V8.1 |
| `Executor` | Work Step execution (domain-specific task) | Behaviour Qualifier: Task/Workstep |
| `Schedule` | Task Definition within a Service Domain | Task Management capability |
| Execution audit trail | Work Step status tracking (TRIGGERED/COMPLETED/FAILED) | PROCESS pattern state management |
| Catch-up on startup | Missed window detection (operational resilience) | Workflow Management capability |
| Redis distributed lock | First-order Service Domain coordination | Distributed coordination model |
| Dynamic schedule reload | Behaviour Qualifier refinement at runtime | Runtime task management |

### BIAN Design Principle: Distributed, Not Central

    ┌────┼────────────┬──────────────┐
    │                 │              │

 (dependent)     (dependent)     (dependent)
```

Each Service Domain retains full ownership of what it schedules, when, and
how it handles execution results. The shared package provides the mechanical
infrastructure (cron lifecycle, locking, audit trail) without imposing
cross-domain coordination.

## Problem Statement

### Duplication

Three services independently implement the same scheduler skeleton:

| Component | payment-order | reconciliation | forecasting |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `robfig/cron/v3` setup | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `running`/`stopped`/`mu`/`wg` state | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `Start(ctx)` blocking loop | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Graceful shutdown with timeout | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Execute guard (stopped check + WaitGroup) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Dynamic schedule reload via polling | No | Yes | Yes |
| Redis distributed locking | Idempotency keys | `RedisLeaderElector` | `LeaseManager` |
| DB execution audit trail | No | Yes | No |
| Missed-window catch-up on startup | No | Yes | No |

A fourth worker, `DunningWorker` (PR #889), uses a Redis ZSET polling loop
instead of cron but re-implements the same lifecycle boilerplate. This brings
the total to approximately 1,500 lines of duplicated lifecycle code across
four workers, with subtle divergences in shutdown ordering and error handling
that create maintenance risk.

### Missing Resilience in Forecasting and Billing

The forecasting scheduler (PR #888) and billing scheduler have no execution
persistence. If pods restart, scale to zero overnight, or experience
transient failures:

- **Forecasting**: Silently drops all missed forecast executions. Tenant A's
  `@every 15m` strategy loses 2 executions during a 30-minute deployment.
  No record, no recovery, no operator visibility.
- **Billing**: Uses Redis idempotency keys (48h TTL) for duplicate prevention
  but has no awareness of missed billing cycles beyond Redis TTL expiry.

In a multi-tenant system where different tenants have different schedules, any
gap in scheduler uptime creates invisible data loss with no mechanism for
detection or remediation.

### Inconsistent Distributed Locking

Two independent `bsm/redislock` wrappers exist:

- `services/reconciliation/worker/leader.go` - Single-lock leader election
  (148 lines)
- `services/forecasting/scheduler/lease_manager.go` - Multi-lock per-resource
  leasing (176 lines)

Both implement the same core: `redislock.New()`, `client.Obtain()`,
`lock.Refresh()` in a background ticker, `lock.Release()`, and
context-based cancellation for renewal goroutines. The reconciliation
implementation holds a single lock (leader election pattern), the forecasting
implementation holds multiple (per-strategy lease pattern), but the underlying
mechanics are identical.

## Goals

| Goal | Success Metric |
|------|---------------|
| Single scheduler lifecycle implementation | All three services use `shared/platform/scheduler` |
| DB-backed execution tracking for all schedulers | Every scheduled execution recorded with status lifecycle |
| Missed-window catch-up for all schedulers | On startup, detect and optionally re-execute missed windows |
| Unified distributed locking | Single Redis lock abstraction replaces both `leader.go` and `lease_manager.go` |
| Multi-tenant schedule isolation | Per-tenant execution tracking, per-tenant catch-up |
| Preserve scheduling semantics | Reconciliation: pure refactor with no observable change. Forecasting and billing: existing scheduling preserved, with execution tracking and catch-up added as new resilience capabilities |

## Non-Goals

- Replacing `robfig/cron/v3` with a different scheduling library
- Adding a scheduler UI or API (schedules are defined in service code or config)
- Event-driven scheduling via Kafka (CockroachDB has no LISTEN/NOTIFY; polling remains the pattern)
- Central scheduler service - BIAN explicitly requires Service Domain autonomy
  over scheduling; the shared package is infrastructure, not a service
- Cross-domain schedule coordination (each Service Domain reacts to business events, not scheduler commands)

```

### Layered Abstraction: WorkerLifecycle vs Scheduler

The lifecycle boilerplate (`Start`, `Stop`, `WaitGroup`, `sync.Mutex` state,
graceful shutdown with timeout, health check) is identical across all four
worker implementations. However, the **trigger mechanism** differs
fundamentally:

- **Cron Schedulers** (forecasting, reconciliation, billing) are
  **time-driven**: "It is 12:00, fire this job."
- **Queue Processors** (dunning) are **score-driven**: "Give me the next
  item where score < now."

Forcing ZSET logic into `ScheduleProvider` (which requires a `CronExpr`)
would create a leaky abstraction. Instead, the package exposes two layers:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            WorkerLifecycle                  │
│  Start/Stop, WG tracking, mutex state,      │
│  graceful shutdown, health check            │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┤
│   CronScheduler      │   (future workers)   │
│   + robfig/cron      │   + redis.ZRange      │
│   + ScheduleProvider │   + domain-specific   │
│   + Executor         │     polling           │
│   + catch-up         │                       │
└──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

### Core Abstraction

The scheduler package defines the cron-specific layer; services provide the
domain logic via interfaces:

```go
// ScheduleProvider loads the current set of schedules from the domain's
// source of truth (database, reference data service, config, etc.).
type ScheduleProvider interface {
    ListSchedules(ctx context.Context) ([]Schedule, error)
}

// Schedule represents a single cron-scheduled job.
type Schedule struct {
    // ID uniquely identifies this schedule for tracking and deduplication.
    ID string
    // CronExpr is the cron expression (5-field standard format).
    CronExpr string
    // TenantID scopes execution tracking and locking (required).
    TenantID string
    // Metadata carries domain-specific data passed to the executor.
    Metadata any
}

// Executor performs the domain-specific work when a schedule fires.
type Executor interface {
    Execute(ctx context.Context, schedule Schedule) error
}
```

                              └──────────┘
```

### Execution Audit Trail

Every cron fire is recorded in the database with a status lifecycle:

```text
TRIGGERED ──> COMPLETED   (happy path)
          ──> FAILED      (executor returned error)
          ──> SKIPPED     (duplicate detected - idempotency)

MISSED                    (window detected during catch-up but beyond MaxCatchUpAge)
```

**Schema** (per-tenant, in tenant schema via `setSearchPath()`):

Tenant isolation uses CockroachDB schema-per-tenant, consistent with the
existing reconciliation implementation. Each tenant's connection sets
`search_path` at acquisition time, so no `tenant_id` column is needed in
the table itself.

```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduler_execution (
    id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    scheduler_name  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- e.g. 'forecasting', 'billing', 'settlement'
    schedule_id     VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,  -- domain-specific schedule identifier
    scheduled_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,   -- expected cron fire time
    executed_at     TIMESTAMPTZ,            -- actual execution time (NULL for MISSED)
    completed_at    TIMESTAMPTZ,            -- when execution finished
    status          VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'TRIGGERED',
    result_ref      VARCHAR(200),           -- domain-specific reference (run ID, etc.)
    error_message   TEXT,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

    CONSTRAINT chk_scheduler_execution_status
        CHECK (status IN ('TRIGGERED', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'MISSED', 'SKIPPED'))
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sched_exec_lookup
    ON scheduler_execution (scheduler_name, schedule_id, scheduled_at DESC);
```

This generalises the reconciliation service's existing `scheduler_execution`
table, adding `scheduler_name` so multiple schedulers (forecasting, billing,
settlement) can share the same table within a tenant schema.

### Catch-Up on Startup

When a scheduler starts, it:

1. Queries `ListSchedules()` to get all active schedules
2. For each schedule, queries `LastExecution()` from the DB
3. Determines the catch-up start point:
   - If `LastExecution()` returns a result: start from
     `last_execution.scheduled_at`
   - If no prior execution exists (new schedule or first deployment):
     start from `now() - MaxCatchUpAge`
4. Walks the cron expression forward from the start point to `now`
5. For each missed window:
   - If within `MaxCatchUpAge`: execute via `Executor`
     (records as TRIGGERED -> COMPLETED/FAILED)
   - If beyond `MaxCatchUpAge`: record as MISSED
     (audit trail only, no execution)

The `now() - MaxCatchUpAge` fallback for new schedules prevents unbounded
catch-up storms while still recovering recent missed windows. This is the
exact pattern already proven in the reconciliation scheduler, generalised
for any domain.

### Distributed Locking

The `shared/platform/redislock` package provides two usage patterns from a
single implementation:

**Per-Execution Locking** (forecasting, billing):

```go
lock := redislock.New(redisClient, redislock.Config{
    KeyPrefix: "meridian:forecasting:strategy",
    LockTTL:   5 * time.Minute,
    RenewEvery: 30 * time.Second,
})

acquired, release, err := lock.Acquire(ctx, tenantID, strategyID)
if acquired {
    defer release()
    // execute
}
```

**Leader Election** (reconciliation):

```go
leader := redislock.NewLeader(redisClient, redislock.Config{
    KeyPrefix: "meridian:reconciliation:scheduler",
    LockTTL:   30 * time.Second,
    RenewEvery: 10 * time.Second,
})

isLeader, err := leader.TryAcquire(ctx)
```

Both patterns share the same core: `bsm/redislock` obtain/refresh/release
with background renewal goroutines.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Shared Packages (No Behaviour Change)

1. Create `shared/platform/redislock/` from the union of `reconciliation/worker/leader.go`
   and `forecasting/scheduler/lease_manager.go`
2. Create `shared/platform/scheduler/` with the lifecycle extracted from all three schedulers
3. Create `shared/platform/scheduler/execution_store.go` generalised from
   `reconciliation/worker/execution_store.go`

### Phase 2: Migrate Forecasting Scheduler

1. Replace `forecasting/scheduler/cron_scheduler.go` with the shared scheduler
2. Add execution tracking (new Flyway migration for `scheduler_execution` in forecasting schema)
3. Add catch-up on startup
4. Remove `forecasting/scheduler/lease_manager.go` (use `shared/platform/redislock`)

### Phase 3: Migrate Reconciliation Scheduler

1. Replace `reconciliation/worker/scheduler.go` with the shared scheduler
2. Migrate existing `scheduler_execution` table to shared schema (or keep as-is with adapter)
3. Remove `reconciliation/worker/leader.go` (use `shared/platform/redislock`)
4. Remove `reconciliation/worker/execution_store.go` (use shared implementation)

### Phase 4: Migrate Billing Scheduler

1. Replace `payment-order/worker/billing_scheduler.go` with the shared scheduler
2. Add execution tracking (new migration)
3. Add catch-up for missed billing cycles
4. Redis idempotency keys become defence-in-depth alongside DB tracking

### Phase 5: Migrate Dunning Worker

PR #889 introduces `DunningWorker` in `payment-order/worker/dunning_worker.go`
with the same lifecycle boilerplate (ticker loop, `running`/`mu`/`wg` state,
graceful shutdown). The dunning worker uses Redis ZSET-scored delayed jobs
(`ZRangeByScore`) rather than cron expressions, so it does **not** use
`ScheduleProvider` or `Executor`. Instead it embeds `WorkerLifecycle` directly.

1. Refactor `dunning_worker.go` to embed `scheduler.WorkerLifecycle`
2. Replace dunning's Redis locking with `shared/platform/redislock`
3. Lifecycle tests reuse shared `WorkerLifecycle` test helpers

## Complexity Estimate

| Phase | Description | Points | Parallelisable |
|-------|-------------|--------|:-:|
| 1a | Extract `shared/platform/redislock` | 3 | Yes |
| 1b | Extract `shared/platform/scheduler` (lifecycle + config + metrics) | 5 | Yes |
| 1c | Extract `shared/platform/scheduler` (execution store + catch-up) | 5 | After 1b |
| 2 | Migrate forecasting scheduler | 3 | After 1a, 1b, 1c |
| 3 | Migrate reconciliation scheduler | 3 | After 1a, 1b, 1c |
| 4 | Migrate billing scheduler | 3 | After 1a, 1b, 1c |
| 5 | Migrate dunning worker | 2 | After 1a, 1b |
| **Total** | | **24** | Critical path: 13 |

Phases 2, 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel once their Phase 1 dependencies
are complete. Phase 5 does not depend on 1c (no execution store or
catch-up needed for queue processing).

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Mock `ScheduleProvider`, `Executor`, `ExecutionStore` to test
  lifecycle, catch-up logic, and locking behaviour in isolation
- **Integration tests**: CockroachDB testcontainers for execution store,
  miniredis for distributed locking
- **Migration tests**:
  - Reconciliation (Phase 3): existing test suites must pass unchanged
    (pure refactor, no new behaviour)
  - Forecasting and billing (Phases 2, 4): existing tests must pass, plus
    new tests verifying catch-up behaviour and DB-backed execution tracking
- **Multi-pod simulation**: Start 2 scheduler instances with shared Redis,
  verify only one executes per schedule (same pattern as existing forecasting tests)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Shared package becomes a coupling point | Changes to scheduler affect all services | Stable interface contract; services only implement `ScheduleProvider` + `Executor` |
| Catch-up storm on startup | Many missed windows trigger simultaneous executions | Rate-limit catch-up executions; `MaxCatchUpAge` bounds the window |
| Migration breaks existing behaviour | Scheduling regressions in production | Each phase is a separate PR with full test suite pass; feature-flagged rollout |
| Execution table growth | Unbounded audit trail | Add retention policy (configurable TTL, default 90 days) with periodic cleanup |

## Success Criteria

1. All three cron schedulers use `shared/platform/scheduler` - no service-local
   scheduler lifecycle code
2. Dunning worker embeds `WorkerLifecycle` from the same package
3. All cron-scheduled workloads have DB-backed execution tracking with
   operator-visible audit trail
4. All cron schedulers detect and handle missed windows on startup
5. Single `shared/platform/redislock` package replaces all Redis lock
   implementations (leader election, per-resource leasing, dunning locking)
6. Existing test suites pass after migration; new tests cover catch-up and
   execution tracking for forecasting and billing
7. Net reduction of at least 600 lines of duplicated code
